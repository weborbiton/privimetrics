====================================================================
1. GENERAL PROVISIONS AND COPYRIGHT
====================================================================

The software provided under this License (“Software”) is made available
as "source-available" and is subject to the terms of this License.

All copyrights to the Software (including but not limited to source code,
such as PHP, JS, HTML, CSS, configuration files, and other original elements),
excluding any third-party libraries or components used,
which remain subject to their own respective licenses,
belong to the entity or individual providing the Software
(the “Licensor”).

Definitions:
- Licensee: any person or legal entity that uses the Software.
- Project: any application, service, platform, or system that uses the Software.
- Commercial Project: Software (original or modified) offered directly
  as a standalone product, paid service, SaaS solution, subscription tool,
  or as part of an offer whose primary value is the Software itself.

The Licensee has the right to modify the Software in any manner, including:
- changing function or variable names, project structure, or internal markings,
- creating forks and derivative works,
- adapting the Software for personal, internal, or organizational needs.

Attribution (author or Licensor information) is not required,
but is appreciated.

====================================================================
2. USE OF THE SOFTWARE IN FREE AND COMMERCIAL PROJECTS
====================================================================

The Software may be used in any Project, including Projects that generate
revenue, such as through:
- donations,
- advertisements,
- sale of products or services,
- hosting services,
- online stores,
- paid features or subscriptions within a larger Project,
- affiliate programs.

Such use DOES NOT require the Licensor’s consent, provided that the Software
is not offered directly as a standalone product or as a paid service or
subscription whose primary value is the Software itself.

Example:
Using the Software as a component (e.g. status page, internal tool,
administration panel, or supporting system) within a revenue-generating
service does not require consent under this License.

====================================================================
3. CONDITIONS FOR SOFTWARE OFFERED AS A PAID PRODUCT OR SERVICE
====================================================================

If the Software (original or modified) is offered directly as a standalone
product, paid service, or subscription, and the gross monthly revenue
generated primarily by the Software exceeds 1500 USD
(or the equivalent in another currency), the Licensee is obliged to:

1. Within 60 days of exceeding this revenue threshold, submit the Project
   to the Licensor for review using a communication channel designated
   by the Licensor.
2. Obtain approval for continued commercial use of the Software within
   90 days from the date of submission.

Example:
If the Licensee offers the Software as a paid application, subscription,
or SaaS solution whose main purpose is the Software itself and which
generates revenue exceeding the defined threshold per month,
submission to the Licensor is required.

Using the Software as a component of a larger revenue-generating service
does NOT require submission.

The Licensor commits to issuing a decision within 60 days of receiving
a complete submission.

Lack of approval or explicit refusal obliges the Licensee to immediately
cease commercial use of the Software or obtain a separate commercial license.

Failure to comply with these rules, or continuation of commercial activity
after refusal, constitutes a violation of this License.

====================================================================
4. TRADEMARKS AND BRANDING
====================================================================

Any names, logos, icons, favicons, or other branding elements associated
with the Software may constitute trademarks or protected identifiers
of the Licensor (“Trademarks”), unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Rules for the use of Trademarks:
- Trademarks may be used locally for testing, development, or non-public use.
- Trademarks must not be distributed, published, or used in public Projects
  or as branding elements without permission.
- Any public or commercial use of Trademarks requires prior consent
  from the Licensor.

This License does not grant any rights to use the Licensor’s Trademarks.

====================================================================
5. WARRANTY AND LIABILITY
====================================================================

The Software is provided “AS IS”, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, express or implied,
including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for
a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

The Licensor shall not be liable for:
- any direct or indirect damages arising from the use of the Software,
- loss of data,
- system failures or malfunctions,
- loss of revenue or profits.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Licensor’s total
liability under this License shall not exceed 1.00 USD.

====================================================================
6. LICENSE VIOLATION AND TERMINATION
====================================================================

Any violation of the terms of this License results in the automatic and
immediate termination of all rights granted to the Licensee under this
License, without prior notice.

Upon termination, the Licensee must cease all use of the Software that
violates this License.

All disputes arising from or related to this License shall be governed
by the laws of the Republic of Poland and shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the competent courts of that jurisdiction.

====================================================================
7. LICENSE VERSIONS AND FINAL PROVISIONS
====================================================================

A Licensee who has obtained the Software under this version of the License
retains the right to use the Software under its terms, even if the Licensor
publishes a newer version of the License.

Any exceptions, additional permissions, commercial licenses, or individual
agreements must be granted explicitly and in writing by the Licensor.
